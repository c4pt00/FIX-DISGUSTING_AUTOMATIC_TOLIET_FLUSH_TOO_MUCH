# FIX-DISGUSTING_AUTOMATIC_TOLIET_FLUSH_TOO_MUCH

W for Wire to switch L for lock of stall T for toliet

run a wire from the switch of the toliet with NO INFRARED SENSOR TO NOT AUTOMATICALLY FLUSH EVERY 5 SECONDS WHILE USING THE TOLIET (KEEP THE BUTTON TO PUSH FOR MANUAL FLUSH)

THE WIRE RUNS INSIDE OF THE WALL AS ONE OPTION OR THROUGH A PHYSICALLY TOUCH WIRE GUARD PROTECTING THE WIRE UNTIL IT REACHES THE STALL DOOR LOCK

WHERE THE TOLIET FLUSHES WHEN THE STALL DOOR IS CLOSED AND LOCKED WHEN ENTERING THE TOLIET STALL
OR IT FLUSHES WHEN UNLOCKING AND LEAVING THE TOLIET STALL

BUT THE ACTUAL BUTTON TO FLUSH THE TOLIET WOULD STILL BE PART OF THE TOLIET TO MANUALLY FLUSH THE TOLIET




DOES NOT NEED AN INFRARED SENSOR
THIS IS... A BETTER IDEA THAN THE TOLIET FLUSHING EVERY 5 or 10 SECONDS WHILE ACTUALLY USING THE TOLIET
